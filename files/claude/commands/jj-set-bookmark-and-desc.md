# Set Bookmark and Description

Ensure the current revision has a bookmark and proper commit description.

## Steps

1. **Set bookmark**: Use the `/jj-set-bookmark` command to ensure the revision has a bookmark

2. **Set description**: Use the `/jj-set-desc` command to ensure the revision has a proper commit description

## Important

- Always use `jj` commands, never `git`
- Bookmark prefix is determined from CLAUDE.md in the repository root (if present)
